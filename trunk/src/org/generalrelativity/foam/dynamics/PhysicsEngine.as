/**
 * Takes on the job of advancing the simulation
 * 
 * <p>
 * This should typically be accessed through the more user friendly FOAM interface
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The simulation takes the form:
 * <pre>
 * 1. Let each IODESolver advance the state of their equations
 * 2. Narrow down possible collisions with the coarse collision detector
 * 3. Find actual collisions and generate points of contact
 * 4. Resolve collisions on a pairwise basis
 * 5. repeat 1 - 4 for as many iterations as is depicted in solverIterations
 * </pre></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A notable separation is that of elements responsible for advancing
 * the system and those involved in collision detection/response. 
 * This distinction is made in the vain of modularity- but it doesn't
 * provide the nicest interface for the casual developer; this sort of
 * situation is what FOAM is for.
