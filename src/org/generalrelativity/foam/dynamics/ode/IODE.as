/**
 * Imposes a structure that allows an <code>IODESolver</code> to advance its

 * <p>
 * Although we sacrifice a decent amount of efficiency by stuffing our states
 * and derivatives into Arrays, we gain a tremendous amount of modularity and
 * extensibility. Provided an object implements IODE, and adheres to its
 * structure, a completely swappable IODESolver can advance its state. In other
 * words, it effectively decouples integration.
